					<h1>Turbulence in the ICM</h1>
					<img src="images/bg_turb.png" alt="">
					X-ray observations reveal that the intracluster medium (ICM )hosts turbulent motions across all scales. During the process of hierachical structure formation, cluster mergers and accretion flows drive these motions on cluster scales. Via a turbulent cascade the turbulence heats the plasma, accelerates cosmic-ray particles and amplifies the intracluster magnetic fields. 
					<h2>Enstrophy a measurement for vorticity</h2>
					<p>The turbulence in the ICM is assumed to be mainly solenoidal and hence the enstrophy, i.e. the magnitude of the vorticity, is a good measurement for the turblent motions. In the Eulerian frame, the evolution of enstrophy depends on baroclinic, compressive, stretching, dissipative and advective motions. While baroclinicity is the only true source of enstrophy, the other terms are rather dynamical terms that both amplify and reduce enstrophy. In this work, we used CRaTer to follow the evolution of enstrophy and its source terms in the Lagrangian frame (in which advectiv motions are imbedded in the motion of the tracer particles). We performed this analysis on 10 clusters with masses of a few 10^14 solar masses. </p> 
					<p> We found that the amplification and decay always follows the same sequence of events: During merging events both compressive and baroclinic motions increase and to amplify enstrophy. Hence, enstrophy amplification is mainly connected to shocks. Following these events, enstrophy reaches its maximum and starts to decay. At the same time solinoidal motions start to increase trying to prevent the decay of enstrophy, yet the are not strong enough to withstand this decay. If enstrophy is at its maximum, also its dissipation is at a maximum. We further estimated that a few percent of the dissipated turbulent energy are enough to produce magnetic field strengths of a few micro Gauss, which matches the estimates of radio observations. </p>
